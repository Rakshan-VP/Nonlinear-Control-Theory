\chapter{Input-to-State Stability}\index{Input-to-State Stability}

\section{Overview}\index{Overview}
We have studied two main types of stability: \textbf{Lyapunov stability}, which concerns equilibrium points of unforced state-space systems, and \textbf{input-output stability}, which focuses only on the relation between inputs and outputs. These two concepts lie at opposite ends---one emphasizes internal dynamics, while the other ignores them. To connect these perspectives, we introduce the idea of \textbf{input-to-state stability (ISS)}. ISS considers systems with inputs and analyzes stability in terms of both the state and the inputâ€™s effect.
