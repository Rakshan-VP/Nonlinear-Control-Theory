\chapter{Lyapunov Stability I: Autonomous Systems}\index{Introduction}

\section{Overview}\index{Overview}
In this chapter, we introduce the concept of Lyapunov stability for autonomous systems. The main objective is to analyze the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems without explicitly solving the differential equations. Lyapunovâ€™s direct method provides a systematic way to assess the stability of equilibrium points by constructing an energy-like function, called a Lyapunov function. 
This approach is particularly powerful because it applies to nonlinear systems where exact solutions are often difficult or impossible to obtain. We also discuss different notions of stability such as stability in the sense of Lyapunov, asymptotic stability, and global stability, laying the foundation for further analysis of nonlinear control systems.
